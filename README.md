# BlackJack
A Single-Player BlackJack game between a person (player) and the computer (dealer).
The player will arrive at the computer and start the game. The deck is made and shuffled. The dealer and player will each get two cards in the beginning. The player cannot see the dealer's two cards and vice versa. This also includes the values of the two cards. The player can only see his cards and their values.  After the first 4 cards have been dealt -- two to the player, two to the dealer -- every card dealt after that will be seen by both parties. Whoever reaches 21 wins. Whoever busts first, loses. There is no doubling or splitting. Only HIT and STAND. I imported the following:

 java.util.Random;
 java.util.Scanner;
 java.util.Collections;
 java.util.ArrayList;
 
 To PLAY:
 1) compile files by typing "javac *.java" in terminal
 2) Start game by typing "java Main"
